## 📖 About

Task Tracker is an application designed to enhance the tracking of  activities within an organization. Leveraging .NET 8, Supabase(Postgres), and Entity Framework Core, the project provides a platform for efficient management and monitoring of tasks.

## 🧱 This project was built with:

- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore)

## 🚶‍♂️ Installing and Running

1.  Create an account on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-in?returnTo=%2Fprojects) and start a new project
2.  From the supabase website, get the connection string for .NET
3.  Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/urltapas/task-tracker`
4.  Enter in the project's folder: `cd task-tracker`
5.  Run `dotnet restore`
> If you haven't downloaded .NET yet you can follow this tutorial [Install .NET on Windows, Linux, and macOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/)
1.  Guarantee that you have Entity Framework Core installed globally `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
> If you are using Linux, maybe you will need to add the dotnet-ef to your path.
> Like this:
> ```bash
> sudo nano .bashrc # or sudo nano .zshrc
> # Append this to the bottom of the file
> export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools/"
> ```
